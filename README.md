# About

This is a demo project to introduce myself to Azure services and React hooks. The frontend is just a simple todo app(https://github.com/Matteeh/react-hooks-todo).
The backend is built with .Net and is hosted on Azure app services. The backend consists of three microservices; Auth:(https://github.com/Matteeh/.Net-authorization-microservice), Users:(https://github.com/Matteeh/.Net-users-microservice) and Todos(https://github.com/Matteeh/.Net-todo-microservice).
The database in use is Azure CosmosDB.
